This repository contains the final project for the *Machine Learning Foundations for Product Managers* course, part of the **AI Product Management Specialization by Duke University**.

The project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to solve a real-world regression problem: predicting the net hourly electrical power output of a Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP) based on environmental factors.

> In this video, I explain the problem, approach, models, results, and key learnings from this machine learning project.


## Problem Overview

The objective is to predict the **net electrical power output (PE)** using four key environmental variables:

- `AT` â€“ Ambient Temperature (Â°C)  
- `V`  â€“ Exhaust Vacuum (cm Hg)  
- `AP` â€“ Ambient Pressure (millibar)  
- `RH` â€“ Relative Humidity (%)  

This is a **supervised regression problem**, where the target variable is continuous.

## Dataset

- **9,568** hourly records collected over 6 years from a real CCPP.
- Each record includes environmental conditions and actual power output.

## Models Used

Two machine learning models were implemented and evaluated:

- **Linear Regression** â€“ selected as a simple and interpretable baseline.
- **Random Forest Regressor** â€“ used to capture non-linear relationships and feature interactions.

---

## Evaluation Metrics

The following metrics were used to assess model performance:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **RÂ² Score**
- **5-Fold Cross-Validation**

---

## Results

| Model              | CV MSE (Train) | CV RMSE (Train) | Test MSE | Test RMSE | RÂ² Score (Test) |
|--------------------|----------------|------------------|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| Linear Regression  | 20.911 Â± 0.741  | 4.572 Â± 0.080     | 20.247    | 4.503       | 0.930            |
| Random Forest      | 12.012 Â± 1.028  | 3.463 Â± 0.150     | **10.494**| **3.239**   | **0.964**        |

> **Random Forest** significantly outperformed Linear Regression
